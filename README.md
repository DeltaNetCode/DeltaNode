# DELTA: Distributed Weight Determination In'telligent Application Platform

## Preface

> "People keep asking what Web 3.0 is. I think when scalable vector graphics are used massively on top of Web 2.0 -- where everything is corrugated and folded and doesn't look angular -- and a whole Semantic Web covers a lot of data, you have access to this incredible resource of data."「Tim Berners Lee(2006-5)」

>"Web 1.0 was dial-up, 50K average bandwidth, Web 2.0 was 1M average broadband, so Web3.0 should be a 10M bandwidth, full video network, that feels like Web3.0."「Netflix 创始人 Reed Hastings(2006-11)」

>"The Web 3.0 approach to creating applications will be different. So far the term Web 2.0 has emerged mainly in response to a concept called "AJAX"...... My prediction for Web 3.0 will be a patchwork of applications, With some key characteristics: the application is relatively small, the data is in the Cloud, the application can run on any device (PC or mobile phone), the application is very fast and can be customized a lot, and the application spreads like a virus (social networks, email, etc.)."「EricSchmidt, CEO of Google (2007-8)」

> Web 3.0 = (4C + P + VS+D)， 4C = Content, Commerce,6 Community, C = Context , P = Personalization, VS = Vertical Search，D=Distributed.「Sramana Mitra」

In 2017, Gavin Wood, co-founder of ethereum and founder of Polkadot, formally introduced the concept of distributed Web3.0. Of course, ethereum's smart contract and front-end JS development suite is appropriately named Web3, which also shows ethereum's attitude towards Web3.0.

It is certain that Web3.0 will set off a wave far beyond Web1.0 and 2.0, in this wave, will produce a group of new talent whose market value is much higher than Google, Facebook, Amazon, Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu and other Internet giants. What is more worthy of expectation is that this batch of new talent may appear in the world in a new form of self-organization or ecological circle.

At several blockchain conferences held in the United States and Europe, Web3.0 has replaced blockchain and become the focus of discussion. We believe that more and more friends will soon discover and take the lead to step on the waves of Web3.0, and walk on the waves and dance with the waves.

Recently, there has been an argument that Internet entrepreneurship is dead, that the golden decade of entrepreneurship from 2008 to 2018 has passed. On the surface, this is true. In the highly monopolized environment of capital, data and traffic resources, almost all entrepreneurs and innovative projects are on the road to death or defect. Web3.0 will break this monopoly from the bottom up and reignite the spark of innovation that is currently very weak and fragile, but that can start a prairie fire.

For blockchain industry practitioners, when they have a deep understanding of Web3.0, they will find that blockchain is not the beginning of Web3.0, let alone the end of Web3.0. Blockchain is the golden key to open the door of Web3.0. Those who understand the concept of blockchain will know more about Web3.0 and will reap the biggest dividends in the coming Web3.0 tide.

Web1.0 is a portal that solves the problem of getting information. Web2.0 is a social networking site that solves the problem of shared interaction between communities, but the content belongs to the platform. Web3.0 is a peer-to-peer social web site. Compared with Web 2.0, Web3.0 addresses the issues of user information security and content ownership.

## Brief introduction

In the process of building Web 3.0, the five major infrastructures, namely token system, DAPP ecology, NFT technology confirmation, Metaverse, and DAO organization mode, have solved the problems of user information security and content ownership.

### 1.Token system based on blockchain network. 

A blockchain network is an encrypted distributed bookkeeping technology that can be simply understood as a bunch of large, locked notebooks with the same thing written on them. It is this big public ledger that records the flow of crypto assets from one account to another.

Crypto assets are not issued by central banks, and their value is neither dependent on central bank monetary policy nor directly subject to scrutiny and regulation by government agencies. Unlike fiat money (legal tender, paper money that is legally circulated and issued by governments or national authorities), which has increased the supply through quantitative easing,**Crypto assets typically have their total issuance, issuance mechanism, and issuance pace defined by smart contracts at the time of initial issuance. Its price is determined by the supply and demand mechanism of the market, that is, consensus determines the value.**

Take Bitcoin. October 31, 2008, a pseudonym for Satoshi Nakamoto cryptography expert released a Bitcoin white paper, said that his digital currency is completely point-to-point, through all historical transactions open network, time stamps record the sequence of transactions, the introduction of POW proof of work, the longest chain to get rewards, Solve the common double payment problem in transaction transfers (also known as the "double spend problem", where the same amount of money is paid twice).

When the Bitcoin network was launched in 2009, Bitcoin became the world's first crypto asset and ushered in a new era for the world's monetary system. More than a decade on, more and more people are realizing the value and potential of crypto assets.

With the continuous emergence of new generation crypto assets such as Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and SOL, blockchain technology is also constantly self-repeated calculation and innovation.

As of March 23, 2022, the global market capitalization of crypto assets reached $2 trillion, with Bitcoin accounting for 40% and Ethereum accounting for 18%, according to CoinGecko. Daily trading volume in crypto assets is $100 billion, and CoinGecko now tracks more than 10,000 crypto assets.

### 2.Gradually realize ecological construction based on DELTA underlying technology

The original Bitcoin was designed primarily as an alternative to traditional money, and thus as a medium of exchange and store of value.
If Bitcoin is the originator of blockchain, then the birth of DELTA allows blockchain to have more possibilities than "decentralized distribution of money" -- writing smart contracts and building ecosystems.

**What is a smart contract?**

The essence of smart contract is a kind of program, the content of the program can be infinitely expanded. If the two or more parties to the contract meet the relevant conditions, the contract will be automatically triggered, can not be revoked, and its implementation process and results will be published to the whole network. This is Blockchain 2.0 -- the smart Contract public chain.

Public chain refers to the blockchain in which anyone in the world can read and send transactions and the transactions can be effectively confirmed, and can also participate in the consensus process. In addition to public chain, there are also alliance chain and private chain. Alliance chain is a blockchain managed by multiple institutions or organizations. A private chain is a blockchain where writing permissions are in the hands of only one organization.

Launched in March 2021, the biggest difference between DELTA and the Bitcoin blockchain is that it includes a Turing-complete programming language (Solidity) with its own programming language that allows developers to more easily write "smart contracts" on Ethereum using Solidity, Ethereum also provides a code running environment, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). With this in place, on the DELTA blockchain, decentralized applications (DApps) can be developed, which is now commonly referred to as a website or mobile App that leverages blockchain technology.

**DELTA Chain (DE) provides support for DELTA applications and contracts.**

To recap, DELTA is a programmable blockchain that has applications in many areas, including DeFi, smart contracts, and NFTS.

**Since 2019, a whole new set of economic collaboration approaches have emerged in the blockchain world:**

In the field of Finance, innovation boom of DeFi (Decentralized Finance) appears. A large number of innovative applications have been put into use in traditional links of Finance such as Finance, lending and trading.

### 3.How does DeFi work?

In the modern financial system, financial institutions act as guarantors of transactions. Assets flow through these institutions, giving them enormous power. At DeFi, smart contracts replace financial institutions in transactions.

DeFi smart contracts are Ethereum accounts that hold funds and can send/return funds depending on certain conditions. When a smart contract goes live, no one can change its expiration date, and it will always run as programmed. Contracts are also public and can be checked and audited by anyone.

You can think of DeFi as a hierarchical structure:

Part1. Blockchain-ethereum contains transaction history and account status.

Part2. Assets - DE and other tokens.

Part3. Protocols - Smart contracts provide functionality, for example, services that allow decentralized asset lending.

Part4. Application - A product used to manage and access protocols.

At present, the total locked-in value (TVL) in wealth management and lending has exceeded $100 billion; Innovations in the emerging Decentralized Exchange (DEX) field are also emerging one after another. Uniswap has implemented an automated market maker service with just eight people and 40 lines of code, which is unthinkable in traditional exchanges where a team of hundreds of people is required to support such a service. Similarly, DYDX, the leader of the DEX, surpassed Coinbase, the world's No. 1 compliant crypto exchange, in daily matchmaking volume.

Appeared in the field of play, GameFi (mining), the traditional game, control, such as equipment, skin, and gold in game developers centralized server, does not belong to the player's private property rights, these assets can neither between players within the game, cannot cross flow and trading game platforms. And there is always the risk of backdoor tampering from game developers. The arrival of GameFi solves this dilemma.

With the maturity of NFT (non-fungible token, non-fungible token, blockchain and encryption technology) technology, it is only necessary to map the equipment, skin and other items in the game to a unique NFT address, and then the private property right in the game can be confirmed through blockchain technology. This innovation breathes new life into the game industry and builds the third infrastructure of the Web 3.0 world: the determination of private property rights based on NFTS.

### 4.A figurative representation of the metaverse

 With the gradual improvement of other hardware infrastructure, the Metaverse is a virtual world that is linked and created by technological means, mapping and interacting with the real world, and a digital living space with a new social system. Yuan the universe was born in 1992, the word "avalanche" science fiction, the novel depicts a huge virtual reality world, here, people use digital incarnation to control, and compete against each other in order to improve their own status, it is based on extended reality technology provide immersive experience, twin technology generates a mirror image of the real world, based on digital technology based on block chain structures, economic system, Close integration of the virtual world with the real world in economic systems, social systems, identity systems, and allowing each user to do content production and world editing.

The metaverse is essentially a process of virtualizing and digitizing the real world, requiring a lot of changes in content production, economic systems, user experience, and physical world content. It provides immersive experience based on extended reality technology, generates a mirror image of the real world based on digital twin technology, builds an economic system based on blockchain technology, closely integrates the virtual world with the real world in economic system, social system and identity system, and allows each user to produce content and edit the world.

### 5.DAO organization mode changes the original corporate system

The Web3.0 revolution currently taking place is, in a strict sense, a social organization revolution. In the next decade, decentralization, project-based, proportional to the amount of value created, and the redefinition of ownership will continue to impact existing corporate governance structures.

In management circles, this type of innovation used to be called the "starfish model" or the "amoeba model." In the Internet world, we call it DAO(Distributed Autonomous Organization). DAO is a thorough subversion of the modern corporate system, especially the ownership problem. It has the soul of modern companies, but it has abandoned the ownership structure and governance structure of modern companies. Through distributed algorithms, DAO organizations are able to achieve openness, transparency, automatic coordination, and global collaboration, firmly coupling everyone together. The DAo-oriented organization is expected to inherit the advantages of the corporate system, while making up for the limitations of the company's large bureaucratic organization and its responsibility only to shareholders and profits. The revolutionary significance of DAO lies in that, if realized, it will completely release the creativity of individual human beings and create new value opportunities while improving efficiency through reforming the way of collaboration. Hence, the DAO organization pattern, as the fifth infrastructure of the Web3 world.

## Define

### 1.DELTA is a distributed decentralized application platform based on Web3.0 technology created by the scion devan foundation and R3.

In the DELTA decentralized application platform, users (enterprises and individuals) can interact with each other to meet their own needs, and the results are transformed into digital assets for value creation, distribution and circulation.

In the DELTA ecosystem, the ownership of anything posted by any user will be theirs. In DELTA ecosystem, enterprises can be linked with one click, and creators create and own the rights and never switch. At the same time, DELTA ecology provides multiple channels for users, including "NFT creation, publishing, and trading." "Finance empowers traditional supply chain" and so on can better empower ecological categories and also provide soil for market innovation!

**The Sean Devin Foundation**

As an established private equity fund, the Sean Tiffany Foundation was established in 1996, headquartered in Singapore, with branches in eight countries and regions, including the United States, Europe and China. The fund mainly invests in the global equity, bond and financial derivatives markets, and owns several hedge funds and private equity investment funds. From 2009 to 2017, the fund managed by Sean Divan has achieved a compound investment return of around 20% for eight consecutive years, and has been rated as the most stable private equity fund in Asia by Business Week (Asia Pacific Edition). Since the transformation of the service blockchain, the Sean Tiffany Foundation in more than 5 years quantitative fund returns reached 70%. In terms of project investment, the Scion Vativan Fund has invested in a number of high-quality blockchain projects including "IPFS, EOS, COSMOS" and so on.

**R3 Blockchain Consortium**

R3CEV is an R3 company founded in September 2015, which is responsible for the development of industry standards and use cases of synthetic banking blockchain technology. It is mainly committed to providing a channel for banks to explore blockchain technology and establish blockchain conceptual products. At present, more than 100 banks worldwide have joined the R3 alliance! Chief executive David Rutter says R3 has long believed that distributed ledger technology could transform financial services in the same way the Internet has transformed media and entertainment. After the formation of the alliance, a series of seminars were held. While details of the project are scarce, project representatives say R3 wants to build what it calls a "global financial structure," or blockchain and distributed ledger for the needs of the banking industry, and craft its inputs.

### 2.Based on the network

**Super high trading speed**

DNT-20 underlying protocol, pioneering use of block point group structure; The more nodes, the faster the speed. Each transaction type corresponding to each address has its own blockchain. This structural design can increase the transaction speed to 10,000 TPS.

### 4.FGeatures

**Technical support + application support**.

**Asset chain:**Decentralized asset chain transaction, cross-chain technology, convenient, fast and stable.

**Safety effect:**The whole network consists of full nodes, validation nodes and SPV nodes (simplified transaction verification) to maintain the stability and efficiency of blocks.

**Ecological Applications:**Open block contract API interface, creators can easily access, create a powerful ecological application scenario.

### 5.Advantage

**Capital security without worry, multiple technical guarantee.**

Delta. will establish a real-time asset and transaction data query and verification mechanism, and open to the public. Security is key when it comes to trading digital assets. Ensure user privacy and asset security.

**Strong strength, rich operation experience**

DELTA is the world's first ecological application platform based on WEB3.0+ blockchain, strongly supported by two top international institutions. Firstly, it supports the use of the platform's own assets to increase the value of platform assets and enhance the visibility of the platform. In the later stage, it will provide more ecological application services to protect users' assets and provide diversified investment channels.

**Technology is a charm**

DELTA is developed by EVM + Formla strategy, Turing-complete scripting language is tested by EVM simulator virtual machine, and maintain the security of block network based on DNT-20 underlying protocol, Kademlia algorithm, Solidity smart contracts, DPOS entrust certificates and so on.

**Ecological layout, open interface**

DELTA application platform will open API interface, facing global users to access ecological application, all ecological application access will be led by DELTA ecology DAO master, all DAO master will have a unique identity. All participating ecologies will participate in the two ports of traffic and value through voting or confirmation of rights by all DAO members, so as to ensure the healthy and orderly development of ecology.

**The community is fully autonomous and has open and transparent information**

DELTA does not use a traditional centralized corporate structure with a CEO and board of directors. Relying on blockchain technology and the concept of token economy, all DAOs serve as the sole authentication unit of the platform. It will be the first autonomous community ecological incubation platform in the world.

## Value distribution

In addition to finance, games, in social, sports, learning and other fields of human life, also emerged Socialfi (social is mining), Sportfi (sports is mining), Studyfi(learning is mining) and other new economic cooperation methods. Socialfi gives the corresponding token economic rewards to the users by getting more likes and retweets on the social platform. StepN, Sportfi's leading project, encourages users to embrace a healthier lifestyle through rewards linked to their exercise profiles; Let Me Speak, Studyfi's leading project, uses a system of tokens to encourage users to learn languages and memorize more foreign words. These new experience design mechanisms linked to economic incentives are bound to bring a huge impact and reshuffle to each C-terminal industry. In line with the principle of "value is shared by those who create value".

The DELTA intelligent application platform launched the incentive model of the platform, and the digital asset "DE public chain" based on block technology. The proposed DE public chain provides higher security and payment convenience in the field of payment. The expected completion time is 1.5-3 years.
