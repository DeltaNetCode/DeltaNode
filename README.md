# DELTA: Distributed Weight Determination In'telligent Application Platform

## Preface

> "People keep asking what Web 3.0 is. I think when scalable vector graphics are used massively on top of Web 2.0 -- where everything is corrugated and folded and doesn't look angular -- and a whole Semantic Web covers a lot of data, you have access to this incredible resource of data."「Tim Berners Lee(2006-5)」

>"Web 1.0 was dial-up, 50K average bandwidth, Web 2.0 was 1M average broadband, so Web3.0 should be a 10M bandwidth, full video network, that feels like Web3.0."「Netflix 创始人 Reed Hastings(2006-11)」

>"The Web 3.0 approach to creating applications will be different. So far the term Web 2.0 has emerged mainly in response to a concept called "AJAX"...... My prediction for Web 3.0 will be a patchwork of applications, With some key characteristics: the application is relatively small, the data is in the Cloud, the application can run on any device (PC or mobile phone), the application is very fast and can be customized a lot, and the application spreads like a virus (social networks, email, etc.)."「EricSchmidt, CEO of Google (2007-8)」

> Web 3.0 = (4C + P + VS+D)， 4C = Content, Commerce,6 Community, C = Context , P = Personalization, VS = Vertical Search，D=Distributed.「Sramana Mitra」

In 2017, Gavin Wood, co-founder of ethereum and founder of Polkadot, formally introduced the concept of distributed Web3.0. Of course, ethereum's smart contract and front-end JS development suite is appropriately named Web3, which also shows ethereum's attitude towards Web3.0.

It is certain that Web3.0 will set off a wave far beyond Web1.0 and 2.0, in this wave, will produce a group of new talent whose market value is much higher than Google, Facebook, Amazon, Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu and other Internet giants. What is more worthy of expectation is that this batch of new talent may appear in the world in a new form of self-organization or ecological circle.

At several blockchain conferences held in the United States and Europe, Web3.0 has replaced blockchain and become the focus of discussion. We believe that more and more friends will soon discover and take the lead to step on the waves of Web3.0, and walk on the waves and dance with the waves.

Recently, there has been an argument that Internet entrepreneurship is dead, that the golden decade of entrepreneurship from 2008 to 2018 has passed. On the surface, this is true. In the highly monopolized environment of capital, data and traffic resources, almost all entrepreneurs and innovative projects are on the road to death or defect. Web3.0 will break this monopoly from the bottom up and reignite the spark of innovation that is currently very weak and fragile, but that can start a prairie fire.

For blockchain industry practitioners, when they have a deep understanding of Web3.0, they will find that blockchain is not the beginning of Web3.0, let alone the end of Web3.0. Blockchain is the golden key to open the door of Web3.0. Those who understand the concept of blockchain will know more about Web3.0 and will reap the biggest dividends in the coming Web3.0 tide.

Web1.0 is a portal that solves the problem of getting information. Web2.0 is a social networking site that solves the problem of shared interaction between communities, but the content belongs to the platform. Web3.0 is a peer-to-peer social web site. Compared with Web 2.0, Web3.0 addresses the issues of user information security and content ownership.
